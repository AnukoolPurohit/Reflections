When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I would use a remote repository to share my work and collobarte with other
    developers. I can also use it as a backup incase I was changin systems or 
    face problems on my local system. 
    I can choose to keep the repository local as long as I think it's not "ready"
    at which point I can push changes to the remote.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So that we can choose what to pull from the remote rather than bringing 
    everything because we may not need it.

    Also beause you may not have commited everything on the local repository any new
    changes need to be brought in after that to make sure nothing is lost.
